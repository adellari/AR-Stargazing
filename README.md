# AR-Stargazing
 A mobile augmented reality app for stargazing

## Overlay Selection 
Three distinct modes are available for content overlay: Planetarium, Hemisphere, and Segmentation. The distinction comes from how the sky night is masked and imposed on top of the real world.

## Sky Band Composition
ï¿¼The user is able to select among several predefined wavelength band options to through which to view the sky. Different bands provide information like hidden the hidden dust clouds that make up nebulas, which may only absorb photons outside the visible range. By enabling different combinations of wavelengths, a composite image of the complete sky, which is largely invisible to the naked eye, is formed.
